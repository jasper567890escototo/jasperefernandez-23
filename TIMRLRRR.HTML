    <h1>Portfolio Output No.5: My Personal Timeline With Reflection</h1>
     
    <p> 1. The center of my life is being an athlete. This identity allowed me to learn discipline, courage, and the value of collaboration. The title "Athlete at Heart" reflects my love and dedication to sports, highlighting the experiences and lessons that have shaped my personality and inspired me in every challenge I have faced.</p>
   
    <p>2. At the turning points of my life, I experienced fear and doubt, but it gave me strength. With every challenge, I decided to fight and learn from mistakes. My actions, such as asking for help and accepting change, opened up new opportunities. In the end, I leemed that every trial is an opportunity for personal growth and strengthening my self-belief.</p>
    <p>3. My family is the most important thing in my life. My parents taught me lessons in hard work, perseverance, and love. They are my inspiration every step of the way. My friends, on the other hand, have been a support in trials and give me joy every day. In their presence, I learned to value relationships and friendships, which gave me strength and self-confidence in my dreams.</p> 
    <p>4. If i had a chance to change or add one thing to my life, I would like to have more time for family. This change will bring about deeper connection and satisfaction, which will help my mental health. It may open more opportunities for support and love in my life.</p> 
    <p>
        5. In one year, I want to achieve personal goals. In five years, I want to succeed in my career and have a stronger relationship. In ten years, I hope to have a family and contribute to society. Will continue to learn and improve.</p>
